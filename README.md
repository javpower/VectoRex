## **Why Choose VectoRex?**

### **Technical Features**

- **High-Performance Search**: Based on the advanced HNSW algorithm, it supports fast search of large-scale vectors, providing users with an efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search experience.
- **Hybrid Query**: Intelligently combines vector search with scalar filtering, supporting complex query scenarios such as finding images most similar to a given image with the tag "landscape" or documents most similar to a given text published within the last week.
- **Persistent Storage**: Built-in efficient data storage mechanisms ensure the safety and quick recovery of large-scale datasets, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability.
- **Flexible Index Management**: Covers scalar indexes (inverted index, range index) and vector indexes, supporting dynamic addition, deletion, and updating of vector data to meet diverse indexing needs.
